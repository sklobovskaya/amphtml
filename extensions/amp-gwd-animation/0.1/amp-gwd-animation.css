 * GWD AMP ads with pages use an amp-carousel component as a pagedeck.
 * The amp-carousel component's slide wrapper elements' height is slightly
 * shorter than the carousel's, which causes the slides to be misaligned in
 * their containers and cropped at the top. This works around the issue by
 * unsetting `height: 100% !important` from the slides container on the pagedeck
 * amp-carousel. GWD pages have an explicit height set and display correctly in
 * the slider without the 100% height style on the container.
